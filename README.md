# BioinformaticsDataAnalysis
This is the file directory which contains all the scripts using Python pandas and matplotlib to analyze variant pathogenicity data. 

In many files, I define functions which are then imported and called by other files. This is so that I don't have just one big file with a tons of lines. Instead, I've decoupled steps in my analysis pipeline according to the exact operation performed on a given input. 

The files I am analyzing and visualizing are machine and deep learning Bioinformatics algorithms developed by researchers at the Center for the Study of Systems Biology at Georgia Tech. The algorithms I had used are ENTPRISE, ENTPRISE-X, and MEDICASCY. Please check "https://sites.gatech.edu/cssb/entprise/" for more information on these specific algorithms.
